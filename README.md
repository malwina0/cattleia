# cattleia: Complex Accessible Transparent Tool for Learning Ensemblers In AutoML

<img src="misc/logo.png" align="right" width="150"/>

***cattleia*** is a Dash application for analysing model ensembles produced by AutoML packages in Python: [`auto-sklearn`](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn), [`AutoGluon`](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon) and [`FLAML`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML). 

:cherry_blossom: through tables and visualizations, allows to look at the metrics of the models to assess their contribution to the prediction of the built committee

:cherry_blossom: introduces compatimetrics, which enable analysis of model similarity

:cherry_blossom: enables the analysis of weights and how they impact the model by allowing their modification

## Motivation
The motivation for the research is to understand the inner workings of ensemble models and to develop new insights and techniques that can be used to improve the performance of AutoML models in tabular data prediction. The *cattleia* aims to improve the trustworthiness and interpretability of AutoML. The goal is to make this tool intuitive to use, the same time providing valuable information and analysis.
